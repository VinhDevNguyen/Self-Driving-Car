# Behavioral Cloning for Self Driving Car - Keras/Tensorflow
Requirements and Downloads
---
### Environments
* Python 3.7.4 with Anaconda
* Tensorflow 2.2

### Simulator
* [Udacity Self-Driving Car Simulator](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim)

### Usage
#### Run simulator using trained network
Run the simulator and select autonomous mode.
* With original Nvidia model, we type:

```
python drive.py model3.h5
```
* With Modified Nvidia model, we type:

```
python drive.py model3_icep.h5
```
